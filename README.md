# Game-Music-Player
A Unity Game I created to play music from a folder. A game made from learning Audio Visualization and Shader Graphs... Is this even a game? 

**Description**
This game was made while I was learning Shader Graphs, I thought about a beating disco ball and shiny floor for visuals which could change when the beats are playing.
I went to find an Audio Visualization video by  Renaissance Coders (Video: https://youtu.be/PzVbaaxgPco)

He did most of the heavylifting in this game from his code so do check up on that.

**User Input**
The only input the user has to put in is the full path of the music folder into the inputfield when starting the game.
Well, there's also the music controller on the top left side, tap the button to let it slide out Automatically.
But do know that the progress bar is just for show, you can't do anything with it.
